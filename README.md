# 7GUIs implemented using Concur

[Purescript-Concur](https://github.com/ajnsit/purescript-concur) is a brand new client side Web UI framework for Purescript that explores an entirely new paradigm. It does not follow FRP (think Reflex or Reactive Banana), or Elm architecture, but aims to combine the best parts of both.

[7GUIs](http://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) is a set of seven tasks that represent typical challenges in GUI programming.

This repo contains Concur implementations for the 7GUIs tasks. You can see a [running demo](https://ajnsit.github.io/concur-7guis/). [The source](https://github.com/ajnsit/concur-7guis/blob/master/src/Main.purs) also serves as a good introduction to all the important aspects of Concur.

If you are interested in a more in-depth tutorial for Concur, check out the [Concur Documentation site](https://github.com/ajnsit/concur-documentation/blob/master/README.md).

API documentation is also [published on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-concur-react).
